Hi! I'm **Aaron**, I am learning how to code using Markdown. You can find a super easy way to do it [here] (https://stackedit.io/)

 A growth mindset is when you understand that their abilities can be developed. Effort defines knowledge.

Three ways I remind myself to keep a growth mindset is by:

 - Never being envious
 - Always taking critisism with grace
 - Never having a proud heart and knowing I always have room to be better

I enjoy making list! Some of my favorite subjects to list are:

 - Favorite animals
 - Favorite smells
 - Favorite colors

Here is a table: 

| 1 | 2 |
|--|--|
| 3 |4  | 

> Blockquote

how cool is that?
